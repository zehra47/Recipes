            <h4>Description</h4>
            <pre>Maggi masala recipes are part of every Indian household. All of us have grown up and loved these Maggi recipes – be it the plain Maggi noodles recipe, Cheese Maggi, Egg Maggi or our own versions of it. Even after growing up, Maggi is your BFF if you live in a PG or hostel, especially on days you’re broke.

                Now if you live in a Stanza Living’s residence, you don’t have to worry about eating Maggi for five days a week. Our delicious, homely meals will make sure you don’t go to bed hungry. But if you live alone and have to cook or order your meals, these easy-to-cook Maggi recipes will save your day. Honestly, what would have happened to us if Maggi was banned forever?
